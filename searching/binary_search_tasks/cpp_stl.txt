BINARY SEARCH:

binary_search(startaddress, 
              endaddress, valuetofind)
Parameters :
startaddress: the address of the first 
              element of the array.
endaddress: the address of the next contiguous 
            location of the last element of the array.
valuetofind: the target value which we have 
             to search for.
Returns :
true if an element equal to valuetofind is found, else false.

LOWER AND UPPER BOUND:

Iterator lower_bound (Iterator first, Iterator last, const val):
lower_bound returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the range 
[first,last] which has a value not less than ‘val’  and if the value is not present in the vector 
then it returns the end iterator.

Iterator upper_bound (Iterator first, Iterator last, const val)
upper_bound returns an iterator pointing to the first element in the range [first,last] which 
has a value greater than ‘val’ and if the value is not present in the vector then it returns 
the end iterator.
